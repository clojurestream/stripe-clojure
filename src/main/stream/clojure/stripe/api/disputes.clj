    - charge (String): Only return disputes associated to the charge specified by this charge ID.
    - created (Unknown): Only return disputes that were created during the given date interval.
    - ending-before (String): A cursor for use in pagination. `ending_before` is an object ID that defines your place in the list.

    - expand (Array): Specifies which fields in the response should be expanded.
    - limit (Integer): A limit on the number of objects to be returned. Limit can range between 1 and 100, and the default is 10.
    - payment-intent (String): Only return disputes associated to the PaymentIntent specified by this PaymentIntent ID.
    - starting-after (String): A cursor for use in pagination. `starting_after` is an object ID that defines your place in the list.
