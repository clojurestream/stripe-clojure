  Path Parameters:

(defn list-all-payment-methods
  "List PaymentMethods

  HTTP Method: GET
  Endpoint: /v1/payment_methods

  Query Parameters:
    - customer (String): The ID of the customer whose PaymentMethods will be retrieved.
    - ending-before (String): A cursor for use in pagination. `ending_before` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, starting with `obj_bar`, your subsequent call can include `ending_before=obj_bar` in order to fetch the previous page of the list.
    - expand (Array): Specifies which fields in the response should be expanded.
    - limit (Integer): A limit on the number of objects to be returned. Limit can range between 1 and 100, and the default is 10.
    - starting-after (String): A cursor for use in pagination. `starting_after` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with `obj_foo`, your subsequent call can include `starting_after=obj_foo` in order to fetch the next page of the list.
    - type (String): An optional filter on the list, based on the object `type` field. Without the filter, the list includes all current and future payment method types. If your integration expects only one type of payment method in the response, make sure to provide a type value in the request.

  Example Usage:
    (list-all-payment-methods {:query-params {:limit 10}})"
