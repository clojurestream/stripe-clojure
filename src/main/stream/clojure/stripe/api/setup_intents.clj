  HTTP Method: GET
  Endpoint: /v1/setup_intents

  Query Parameters:
    - attach_to_self: If present, the SetupIntent's payment method will be attached to the in-context Stripe Account.

It can only be used for this Stripe Accountâ€™s own money movement flows like InboundTransfer and OutboundTransfers. It cannot be set to true when setting up a PaymentMethod for a Customer, and defaults to false when attaching a PaymentMethod to a Customer.
    - created: A filter on the list, based on the object `created` field. The value can be a string with an integer Unix timestamp, or it can be a dictionary with a number of different query options.
    - customer: Only return SetupIntents for the customer specified by this customer ID.
    - ending_before: A cursor for use in pagination. `ending_before` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, starting with `obj_bar`, your subsequent call can include `ending_before=obj_bar` in order to fetch the previous page of the list.
    - expand: Specifies which fields in the response should be expanded.
    - limit: A limit on the number of objects to be returned. Limit can range between 1 and 100, and the default is 10.
    - payment_method: Only return SetupIntents that associate with the specified payment method.
    - starting_after: A cursor for use in pagination. `starting_after` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with `obj_foo`, your subsequent call can include `starting_after=obj_foo` in order to fetch the next page of the list.
