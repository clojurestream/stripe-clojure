(defn list-all
  "List all products

  HTTP Method: GET
  Endpoint: /v1/products

  Query Parameters:
    - active (Boolean): Only return products that are active or inactive (e.g., pass `false` to list all inactive products).
    - created (Unknown): Only return products that were created during the given date interval.
    - ending-before (String): A cursor for use in pagination. `ending_before` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, starting with `obj_bar`, your subsequent call can include `ending_before=obj_bar` in order to fetch the previous page of the list.
    - expand (Array): Specifies which fields in the response should be expanded.
    - ids (Array): Only return products with the given IDs. Cannot be used with [starting_after](https://stripe.com/docs/api#list_products-starting_after) or [ending_before](https://stripe.com/docs/api#list_products-ending_before).
    - limit (Integer): A limit on the number of objects to be returned. Limit can range between 1 and 100, and the default is 10.
    - shippable (Boolean): Only return products that can be shipped (i.e., physical, not digital products).
    - starting-after (String): A cursor for use in pagination. `starting_after` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with `obj_foo`, your subsequent call can include `starting_after=obj_foo` in order to fetch the next page of the list.
    - url (String): Only return products with the given url.
