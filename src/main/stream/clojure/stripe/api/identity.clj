(defn list-all-verification-sessions
  "List VerificationSessions

  HTTP Method: GET
  Endpoint: /v1/identity/verification_sessions

  Query Parameters:
    - client-reference-id (String): A string to reference this user. This can be a customer ID, a session ID, or similar, and can be used to reconcile this verification with your internal systems.
    - created (Unknown): Only return VerificationSessions that were created during the given date interval.
    - ending-before (String): A cursor for use in pagination. `ending_before` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, starting with `obj_bar`, your subsequent call can include `ending_before=obj_bar` in order to fetch the previous page of the list.
    - expand (Array): Specifies which fields in the response should be expanded.
    - limit (Integer): A limit on the number of objects to be returned. Limit can range between 1 and 100, and the default is 10.
    - related-customer (String): The related-customer parameter.
    - starting-after (String): A cursor for use in pagination. `starting_after` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with `obj_foo`, your subsequent call can include `starting_after=obj_foo` in order to fetch the next page of the list.
    - status (String): Only return VerificationSessions with this status. [Learn more about the lifecycle of sessions](https://stripe.com/docs/identity/how-sessions-work).
