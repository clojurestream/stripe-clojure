# Contributing

As this project is still in flux, we are currently focusing on improving the design, usability, and overall developer experience of the library. At this time, we welcome your suggestions, ideas, and discussions regarding:

- **API Design & Usability:**  
  How intuitive are the resource-specific namespaces and function signatures? Do the naming conventions (e.g. using operation IDs, converting from camelCase to kebab-case) make sense? What improvements would help your experience using the SDK?

- **Configuration & Versioning:**  
  Are the approaches to configuring the API key (via dynamic vars) and capturing the Stripe API version clear and convenient? How could we improve this aspect?

- **Documentation:**  
  Is the provided documentation (including docstrings with example usages) sufficient? What additional information or examples would help you integrate the SDK into your projects?

At this stage, we're primarily interested in design feedback and suggestions on how to improve the developer experience rather than direct code contributions. Please feel free to open issues or join our discussion on GitHub to share your thoughts.

Before submitting any code contributions, we kindly ask that you discuss your ideas via an issue or a design discussion so that we can align on the project direction.

Thanks!
